# Contributing to ZIGGO

## Reporting a bug

File bugs in the [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Horacehxw/Ziggo-Device/issues). Please follow these guidelines:

- Search existing issues first, make sure yours hasn't already been reported.
- Consider enabling debug mode so that you can provide as much details as possible when reporting the issue.
- Stay on topic, but describe the issue in detail so that others can **reproduce** it.
- **Provide a screenshot** if possible. A screenshot showing the problem is often more useful than a paragraph describing it.

> The development team will only answer questions on github issues and reject other forms of questions.

## Contributing to ZIGGO's code

If you want to start contributing to the project's code, please follow these guidelines before creating a pull request:

- The top post of the pull request should contain a full, self-contained explanation of the feature: what it does, how it does it, with examples of usage and screenshots. Also explain why you want to add this - what problem does it solve. Do not simply add a text `Implement feature #4345` , because the information there will most likely be outdated or confusing (multiple discussions and opinions). The pull request needs to be self-contained.
- Bug fixes are always welcome. 
- A good way to easily start contributing is to pick and work on a good first issue. We try to make these issues as clear as possible and provide basic info on how the code should be changed, and if something is unclear feel free to ask for more information on the issue.
- Before adding a new feature, ask about it in the [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Horacehxw/Ziggo-Device/issues) , or check if existing discussions exist to make sure the new functionality is desired.
- Pull requests that make many changes using an automated tool, like for spell fixing, styling, etc. will not be accepted.
- Pull requests that address multiple issues will most likely stall and eventually be closed. This is because we might be fine with one of the changes but not with others and untangling that kind of pull request is too much hassle both for maintainers and the person who submitted it. So most of the time someone gives up and the PR gets closed. So please keep the pull request focused on one issue.
- **Do not mark your reviewer's comments as "resolved"**. If you do that, the comments will be hidden and the reviewer will not know what are the pending issues in the pull request. Only the reviewer should resolve the comments.
